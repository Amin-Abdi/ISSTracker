# ISSTracker

Website for tracking the current location of the International Space Station.
You can check when the ISS will be overheard at a certain location by using its latitude and longitude.
The website also displays the names of the astronauts that are currently in space.

## APIs USED

To get the current location of the ISS I used [wheretheiss at](https://wheretheiss.at/)

For the overhead times and the names of the astronauts, [open notify api](http://open-notify.org/)

The current location is updated every second since there is a rate limit
